      <h1>Choose Boring Technology</h1>
      <p>
        This is the spoken word version of my essay, <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose Boring Technology</a>. I have largely come to terms with it and the reality that I will never escape its popularity. </p>
      <p>
        I gave this most recently at the WikiMedia Foundation&rsquo;s developer conference, where <a href="https://twitter.com/cscottnet">Scott Ananian</a> called it &ldquo;how to be old, for young people.&rdquo;

              I work for a company called Mailchimp, or Mailkimp if you listen to podcasts. I was an early employee at Etsy, and that was a formative experience for me, so I’ll refer to my time there a lot. But I’ve worked for a few other places since.

              I’ve worked at big companies and at smaller ones, and at my own tiny startups. I’ve noticed a few things.<br /><br />Big companies can have a branded way of doing engineering. For example, “The Etsy Way” of doing engineering became a thing. Living inside of that box where your needs are met and questions are answered can spoil you somewhat. <br /><br />But I’ve also been in situations where “the way engineering is done” is actively being figured out, or in periods of transition. And in those situations I’ve had to ponder a couple of questions.

              Another question I care about is: how do you make developers happy? This matters to me, as a developer. I would like to be happy, if possible.

              If you go up to a developer and say, “hey, what would make you happy?” you often get highly specific answers. “I would be happy if I could write Clojure at work,” they’ll say, “so you should let me do my work in Clojure.” I don’t discount that when they do this, developers are genuinely describing some kind of endorphin-rich experience they have had at some point.<br /><br />However, I am skeptical that the state that they’re describing is the highest level of spiritual attainment possible.

              Etsy for example, early on, was a big ball of PHP spaghetti. It was written by someone that was unfortunately learning PHP as he was writing it. <br /><br />I spent several years just trying to avoid dealing with it. At one point I tried building Scala services that talked to MongoDB. I thought this would result in better infrastructure, solve all of my productivity problems, and would make me happy. But no part of that turned out to be the case. <br /><br />The embarrassing wreckage of this period is still on the internet, you can go find it and make fun of me. And Etsy employees still give me shit about it, with good cause.

              When I had my own startup last, I did use Clojure. I don’t think that Clojure is the reason, but I should disclaim here that that startup is no longer in business. <br /><br />Anyway I want to offer these anecdotes as my non-luddite bona fides. I am not someone that has never experienced the joy of functional programming. <br /><br />You don’t need to @ me to talk about Scala or Haskell. You certainly don’t need to do that with a rebuttal taking all of this extremely personally, even though I haven’t even mentioned you or those languages at all, Steve.

              I don’t think I’ve become that way because I’ve gotten old and cranky. Although I am certainly those things, I think I’ve gotten perspective on this by summiting Maslow’s hierarchy at some point in my past.<br /><br />Maslow’s hierarchy, briefly, is the idea that you have to satisfy your more basic needs before higher levels of intellectual fulfillment are possible. You can’t do poetry if you’re worried about what you’re going to eat today. <br />

              We can look to the case of Siegfried Sassoon and ponder whether this is the case or not for poetry, but I think it's mostly true in software. You can’t worry about the big picture and ask intelligent questions about the direction of the product if you’re busy arguing about which database or alerting system to use.<br /><br />I’ve been pretty lucky to have been in situations where those basic needs were fulfilled. And I want to help get others to this state.

              I like to think about it like this. Let’s say that we all get a limited number of innovation tokens to spend. This is a purely fictional construct I just made up, and my ICO goes on sale next week.<br /><br />These represent our limited capacity to do something creative, or weird, or hard. We really don’t have that many of these to allocate. Early on in a company’s life, we get like maybe three. Not too many more than that.

              So what’s your company trying to do? Well, Etsy, where I used to work, used to make the claim that it was trying to reshape the entire world economy.<br /><br />Now I don’t know the extent to which we should take tech company missions seriously. I am beginning to suspect that we should not take them seriously at all. <br /><br />But let’s be naive for a minute, and consider the implications that would result if they really wanted to do this.

              If you think about innovation as a scarce resource, it starts to make less sense to also be on the front lines of innovating on databases. Or on programming paradigms. <br /><br />The point isn’t that these things can’t work. Of course they can work. And there are many examples of them actually working. <br /><br />But software that’s been around longer tends to need less care and feeding than software that just came out.

              When we don’t know something, there are really two different categories that that lack of knowledge can be in.<br /><br />There are known unknowns, that is, things that we know that we don’t know. And there are unknown unknowns, things that we don’t know and that we don’t know that we don’t know.

              This applies in technology. This is an example of a known unknown. For a given database, we might not know what happens when a network partition occurs. But we know that a network partition is possible. Since we know that this is possible, we can test for this. Or we can just cross our fingers and hope that it doesn’t happen. Either way, we are informed about the possibility.

              There are also unknown unknowns in technology. This is a random example I saw a while back. This person spent four months trying to figure out why he was getting GC pauses, and it turned out to be because he was writing stats to a file. He had no idea that that was a thing that could happen, but it was.<br /><br />Many bugs in software are like that. We don’t know they’re there, and we don’t even really know we should be on the lookout for them. They’re unknown unknowns.

              <a name="28"></a>
              Now, it’s important to realize that both categories are present in all software. Software that’s 10 years old generally comes with a JIRA instance full of tickets describing broken stuff that nobody’s ever going to fix. And then there are always bugs that nobody knows about, even in software that’s been around forever.

              But it’d be wrong to say that all technology is therefore equivalent. New technology has a larger cardinality for both of these sets. <br /><br />New tech typically has more known unknowns, and many more unknown unknowns. And this is really important.

              I chose “boring technology” as the pithy SEO-friendly title for this content, and I regret it most days.

It’s a real shitshow.<br /><br />But what I’m aiming for there is not technology that’s “boring” the way CSPAN is boring. I mean that it’s boring in the sense that it’s well understood. It’s bad, but you know why it’s bad. You can list all of the main ways it will let you down.

              In my experience it is about here where the wheels come off. People lose their shit and start beating their polyglot programmer drums. There’s something about the idea of adding a new database that has people storming the Bastille, saying “you can’t stop us from using the best tool for the job, man.”<br /> <br />And when people succumb to this instinct they tell themselves that they’re giving developers freedom. And sure, it is freedom, but it's a very narrow definition of what freedom is.

              So polyglot persistence is not the kind of freedom we are looking for, and honestly I wish Martin Fowler would just take the damn bliki about it down already.<br /><br />If you’re giving individual teams (or gods help you, individuals) free reign to make local decisions about infrastructure, you’re hurting yourself globally. <br /><br />It’s freedom, sure.

              Here’s a totally reasonable way to build activity feeds, if that’s all you’re trying to do. You get events from the outside world, then you write them to a database. Then an offline process comes along and aggregates those, sprinkles some machine learning on things, and stuffs a materialized newsfeed into a thing like Redis for serving frontend traffic. This would totally work great.

              But when we set out to build activity feeds, we didn’t have Redis. We did have Memcached. They’re sort of similar in the sense that you can shove a blob in them, and get it back out with a similar API. But they have very different guarantees. The most relevant difference to us here is that Redis is persistent, and Memcached is ephemeral.<br />

              What that means is that if you want to build an activity feed with Memcached, you have to do a bunch of extra work. You have to cope with the possibility that Memcached has gotten rid of your data at the moment you want it. <br /><br />That creates a ton more work when it comes to writing the code to deliver the feature. But we weighed that against the persistent cost of operating a new kind of database, and decided that we’d bite the bullet and build the feature on Memcached.<br />

              Then one day I said, “hey, I wonder how activity feeds is doing.” And I looked at it and was surprised to discover that in the time since we’d launched it, the usage had increased by a factor of 20. And as far as I could tell it was totally fine.<br /><br />The fact that 2,000% more people could be using activity feeds and we didn’t even have any idea that it was happening is certainly the greatest purely technical achievement of my career.

              The reason it was possible was because we used the shared stack. There were people around whose job involved noticing that we needed more MySQL’s or cron boxes or whatever. And there were other people who had to go to the datacenter and plug in new machines. But they were doing that horizontal scaling because the site was growing holistically. Nobody doing this had any awareness of our lone feature.<br />

              If we’d deployed Redis just for activity feeds, you can be sure that Redis would have become distressed at some point as the feature scaled up 20 times. And we would have had to go back and work on Redis just to keep activity feeds working.

              Or more likely, someone else would have had to do it. Our team didn’t exist at all a year later, we were all working on different things. <br /><br />Something I have noticed is that people like cleaning up my messes even less than they like cleaning up their own messes. So this would have gotten awkward and terrible for everyone.

              So I’m making a case here that you should tend to prefer mature things, and you should try not to use too many things.<br /><br />But it’s not an absolute principle. Obviously sometimes it does make sense to add new technology to your stack. And it can even make sense to use a weird new thing. <br />

              The long and short of it is that you have to talk to each other. <br /><br />Technology has global effects on your company, it isn’t something that should be left to individual engineers. You have to figure out a way to make adding technology a conversation.<br /><br />This might be underwhelming if you were expecting a big insightful secret here, but trust me, this is beyond many technology organizations. <br />

              Let’s say you’ve succeeded in gatekeeping new pieces of technology with a conversation. <br /><br />An excellent first question in such a conversation is: “how would we solve the problem at hand without adding anything new?”

              This is a great question to ask because it immediately identifies the situation in which the problem is that we’d like to use a new piece of technology. “Um the problem is that we don’t use Cassandra but maybe we could.” That kind of thing. If you identify this situation, that’s great, because you can immediately stop talking about it.<br /><br />

              But anyway, assuming that you have a real problem, the answer is rarely that you can’t do it. If you have a functioning service of any complexity in production already, and you think you can’t accomplish a specific new feature with what you’ve already have, you’re probably just not thinking hard enough. <br /><br />You may need to resort to unnatural acts, but you can get pretty far with a minimal stack.

              It’s really worthwhile to actually write down what all of the awkward things you’d have to do are. A lot of the time when you do this, you realize that the situation isn’t really that bad. Or it may be bad, but not as bad as the task of operationalizing a new thing. <br /><br />But it can go the other way, too. You can list all of the unnatural acts and conclude that adding a new thing will be worth it.

              And if you decide to try out a new piece of technology, you should figure out low-risk ways to get started. Your tactic should not be to rewrite your entire application with it in one step. You should be proving the technology in production with minimal risk, and then gradually gaining confidence in it.

It might be a long term plan. And you should be committing to rewriting the new thing using the old tools if the new tools don’t actually work out.

Everything still sucks but it feels manageable.<br /><br />The grim paradox of this law of software is that you should probably be using the tool that you hate the most. You hate it because you know the most about it.
